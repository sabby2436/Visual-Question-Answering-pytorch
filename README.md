# Visual-Question-Answering-pytorch

Summer Research Intern at Jadavpur University (June,2018- July 2018)



Research Based Computer Vision Project, built on Pytorch

VQA model using CNN,RESNET-152 model for Image Processing and LSTM for word embeddings, concatenate the two tensors and generated answers. Further using square mean error loss function and tuned the model with Adam Optimizer.

Dataset Used - COCO Dataset
